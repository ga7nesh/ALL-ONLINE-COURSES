# Main idea
I created a collaborative web application to learn how to code. Everyone can create a talk (which are basically just classes) and everyone can enroll in those classes. The main components are:

# Home page
Login/Logout/Register
Talks page in which there are listed all of the different talks or classes and where you can filter talks by different criterias
An individual page for each talk with all of it's information and a button to enroll
A page in which you can access all of the talks in which you are enrolled
A page to create new talks
Distinctiveness and Complexity
The page is not similar to anything we have already created. It's not a social media app nor an e-commerce. It's not similar to other years projects either.

In terms of complexity, I used Django with more than one model (explained below) and several javascript files to the frontend. Moreover, all of the web application is responsive to the different screen sizes (mainly mobile phones and computers).

# Files information
In views.py there is all of the backend code. The main functions are:

Class newTalkForm with all the fields for creating a new talk
Class searchTalkForm for filtering talks
Login, logout and register functions copied from project 4
New_talk for saving a new talk and related information likes tags
Tags for retrieving existing tags and adding new ones
Filter tags: to return a list of talks based on the filters that the user selected
Get_by_title: return talks in which the words appear in title, description or tags
Talk to retrieve information about a specific talk
Enroll: to enroll a talk
Get_enrolled_talks: to retrieve the talks in which you are enrolled
Models.py. The different models are:

# A users model
A model for tags
A model talks with all of the different details about a talk (and a serializer)
Talks.js: to filter talks, show the talks and autocomplete when you search for a talk

New_talk.js: For the second part of creating a new talk which is adding tags. It loads and shows tags, saves new tags and adds the selected tags to the new talk

MyTalks.js: to get the talks in which you are enrolled and show them in the DOM

Templates for all of the different html pages explained above (8 in total including a layout file)

A css file with all of the css used in the web application. Techniques like flexbox and grid are used

Other less important files like urls, admin, settings, static images...

# How to run the application
Install project dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt
Make and apply migrations by running python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate.
